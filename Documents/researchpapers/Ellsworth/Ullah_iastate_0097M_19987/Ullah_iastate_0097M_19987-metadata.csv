Evaluation of object classifier and cross layer network emulator: Application to autonomous vehicle,"Semantic understanding of the perceived world is the key element in autonomous systems' decision-making. The perceived world relies on object classification of each class probability in a given scenario. The widely used approach is the maximum of all class probabilities output of the probability distribution is associated with the object or image in a classification task. A more sophisticated system may also utilize the probability distribution over the classes instead of basing its decision only on the most likely class. The current best approach relies intensively on the accuracy of the model. However, when presented with new data, the model fails to obtain 100\% accurate results. Inaccurate classification leads to unsafe behavior in an autonomous system. Let us take an example of an autonomous system. Suppose there is a pedestrian on the crosswalk. The system will only stop if it correctly classifies the object on the crosswalk. Autonomous vehicles need multiple of sensors and actuators. Running wires to connect all sensors and actuators increases the level of complexity. This thesis presents a new task-based neural network for object classification and compares its performance with a typical probabilistic classification model to improve threshold-based probabilistic decision-making. Furthermore, it introduces a configurable cross layer network emulator known as EMANE with wireless communication optimization for the distributed system based on HeavyBall optimization.",Department of Computer Science,thesis,,Autonomous vehicle,https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-306,https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/handle/20.500.12876/Yr3Kjdar,Theses and Dissertations,2022-08,"Ullah, Hamad","Wongpiromsarn, Tichakorn",Ullah_iastate_0097M_19987.pdf,,Computer science,
