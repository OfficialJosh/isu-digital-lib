Use of machine learning algorithms to classify binary protein sequences as highly-designable or poorly-designable,"By using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) method of training, Na√Øve Bayes and other machine learning algorithms we are able to distinguish between two classes of protein sequences: those folding to highly-designable conformations, or those folding to poorly- or non-designable conformations.","Roy J.
